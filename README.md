# frequency_amongus
Holds the code I used for a mini project

It takes a spreadsheet where the first row is a list of people/places/entities whatever you want. 
Then the column under each lable is a list of items that belong to that person or entity. For example
it could be a list of toys belonging to all the children at a child care center. The code then dedupes 
the columns and gets list of the unique items in the spreadsheet. It outputs a frequency table where 
the first column is the unique list of items. The second is the frequency. The third is the list of 
individuals who have that item.
